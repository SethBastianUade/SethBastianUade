Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sebastian, and I'm passionate about software development and technology. 
I have experience in programming with Java, SQL, and Python, and 
I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In addition to my technical skills, I have worked in the banking and administrative sectors, where 
I developed strong problem-solving and organizational skills, as well as experience working with large data sets and optimizing processes.

I'm currently building projects that demonstrate my passion for technology and my ability to apply programming
and software development skills in real-world scenarios. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me!
